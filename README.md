# spotify-Analytics500-FInalProj

This project is an analysis on the most popular songs from 2010 - 2019. 
Each song has information on the 
  - Genre
  - BPM
  - Energy
  - Dancebility
  - Loudness
  - Liveness
  - Valence
  - Length
  - Acousticness
  - Speechiness
  
Treating all these values as independant variable we will come up with an artificial index (through modelling) that would gauge the popularity of the songs and then compare that with the popularity column of the dataset to check how close or far are we from actual popularity.

Based on this information we can even have a prediction system that if given the all the variables, we can predict the popularity index of the song.
